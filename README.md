# S32K144 Basic

## 1. BUZZ Module

Buzzer Control on S32K144 (PTD16) This module provides an interface to control a passive buzzer using **Port D pin 16 (PTD16)** on the NXP **S32K144**. It allows generation of single tones (notes) and predefined songs using PWM.

### 1.0. Pin Configuration

| Signal     | MCU Pin | Function    |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| Buzzer PWM | PTD16   | Output PWM  |
| LED 3      | PTA11   | Output LED  |

- This pin should be connected to a passive buzzer (through a transistor or driver, if required).

### 1.1. Features

- Generates tones with configurable frequency and duration
- Supports playing sequences (songs)
- Configurable volume (via duty cycle)

### 1.2. How It Works

1. We act directly on the buzzer pin using two for loops: one to define the note frequencies and another for the duration.
2. Notes are represented as frequencies in Hz (e.g., A4 = 440 Hz).
3. A song is an array of `{frequency, duration_ms}` pairs.

## 2. KEY Input Module

This module provides support for reading digital input signals from physical buttons (keys) connected to the **S32K144** microcontroller by NXP. It supports two operation modes: continuous polling or edge-triggered detection, allowing flexible integration depending on application needs.

### 2.0. Pin Configuration

| Key     | GPIO (Port) | Physical Pin | Description        |
|---------|-------------|---------------|--------------------|
| `KEYA`  | `PTD2`       | Pin D2        | Digital input      |
| `KEYB`  | `PTD4`       | Pin D4        | Digital input      |
| `KEYC`  | `PTD3`       | Pin D3        | Digital input      |

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** Keys should be connected to ground (GND) and pulled high by either internal or external pull-up resistors.

### 2.1. Features

- Supports multiple physical keys
- Two operation modes:
  - `MODE_CONT`: Continuous detection while the key is held down (level-triggered)
  - `MODE_NOCONT`: Single detection per press (edge-triggered)
- Active-low key detection
- Supports internal or external pull-up resistors
- Direct GPIO pin mapping using Port D

### 2.2. Dependencies

- NXP SDK GPIO driver
- Prior initialization of GPIO ports and system clocks

### 2.3. Configuration

Before using this module, ensure the following:

- PTD2, PTD3, and PTD4 are configured as digital input pins.
- Pull-up resistors are enabled (either internal or external).
- Operation mode (`MODE_CONT` or `MODE_NOCONT`) is selected by the application code.

## 3. LED Control Module

This module provides support for controlling digital output signals connected to LEDs on the **S32K144** microcontroller by NXP. It enables turning individual LEDs on/off or toggling them dynamically from application code.

### 3.0. Pin Configuration

| LED     | GPIO (Port) | Physical Pin | Description            |
|---------|-------------|--------------|------------------------|
| `LED1`  | `PTC17`     | Pin C17      | Digital output         |
| `LED2`  | `PTD17`     | Pin D17      | Digital output         |
| `LED3`  | `PTA11`     | Pin A11      | Digital output         |
| `LED4`  | `PTA12`     | Pin A12      | Digital output         |
| `LED5`  | `PTA13`     | Pin A13      | Digital output         |
| `LED6`  | `PTA14`     | Pin A14      | Digital output         |

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** LEDs operate in **active-high** mode. A logic HIGH turns the LED on.

### 3.1. Features

- Controls up to 6 independent LEDs
- Basic operations:
  - `LED_ON(led)`: Turns on the specified LED
  - `LED_OFF(led)`: Turns off the specified LED
  - `LED_Reverse(led)`: Toggles the state of the specified LED
- Centralized initialization via `LED_Init()`
- Easy to extend by adjusting the `MAX_LED` macro

### 3.2. Dependencies

- NXP SDK GPIO driver
- Prior initialization of GPIO ports and system clocks

### 3.3. Configuration

Before using this module, ensure the following:

- Pins `PTC17`, `PTD17`, `PTA11`â€“`PTA14` are configured as **digital outputs**.
- External circuitry (e.g., resistors, LEDs) matches the expected voltage and current levels.
- `MAX_LED` is set appropriately if additional LEDs are added or removed.

> ðŸ§ª You can use the `Test_LED()` function as a diagnostic routine to verify the LEDs are correctly wired and responding to commands.
